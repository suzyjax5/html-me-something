<h2>Professional Background</h2>
<p>
My professional background takes on three aspects:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Technology</li>
	<li>Education</li>
	<li>Finance</li>
</ol>	
<p>
<b>Technology</b> is a natural part of almost every career in this age.  And I have always sought out positions that leaned toward technology. Many years ago, I worked as a programmer/analyst for a large financial services firm.  I left that position to take on a Operations Manager position which lead to becoming the head of the IT Projects Office.  Currently, I work as the Core Data Manager for a local school district.  I find this job enjoyable because it allows me to work in both technology and education.  It also taps into my love for data.
</p>
<p>
The majority of my professional experience in <b>education</b> has been in libraries.  I have worked as both a school librarian and a librarian for a state facility.  Both allowed me to teach technology, especially in its use in research and finding data.  In addition to being a certified Library Media Specialist, I am also currently certified to teach Social Scienc, Mathematics, and Technology and Engineering. 
</p>
<p>
My initial professional experience was in the <b>financial services</b> industry.  I have worked for several firms headquarted in St. Louis.  I was a licensed stock broker and principal.  The latter allowed me to supervise other stock brokers as well as serve in a compliance role for the firms where I worked.  I liked this experience because it lead to my work in technology where I was able to use my industry knowledge in this new (for me) area.

<h2>Educational Background</h2>
<p>
I have a bachelors degree from Washington University, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude.  Before that, I earned an associates degree from St Charles Community College, graduating with a 4.0 grade point average.  
</p>
<p>
I believe that learning is ongoing and done over the course of a lifetime.  I am currently enrolled in LaunchCode's LC101 program.  In addition, I try to learn new skills via college-based programs such as those offered by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a>.

<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>
My personal interests are varied.  I like hiking and bicycling.  I have a "bucket list item" of riding the entire length of the Katy Trail.  I plan to spend my Spring Break enjoying the hiking trails of some of our new state parks in Missouri.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy cooking. I don't think there is a kitchen gadget that I do not own.  I like trying new cooking methods and currently have an interest in sous vide cooking...possibly related to the sous vide "gadget" I recently received.

<p>
I also enjoy politics.  I am very involved in local and state politics.  I currently serve as an elected official for my area.  Related to that, I have a strong interest in political applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  I dabble in this  through a business named BallotMapping.
